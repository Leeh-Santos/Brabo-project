lounch brabro token

verify tokenomics for staking and fund                 20$ for liquidity::

and what would be the tokenomics If I want to create a new token to do it? what would be the max supply? 
and how much sould I allocated for the fundme contract and the staking contract? 
consider that I only want to add 20$ for the LP initial liquidity take in consideration that
 also the fundme contract would interact with this nft contract  and also a staking contract

limit for nft?

add get liquidity function 



Deploy fist then check later
**verify if besides swap, only 20% is buy back, 80% liquidity is added and contract grant tokens directly thru contract
can mitigate low liquidity
